# HTML-project
Our goal is to build a profile site. It's a chance to show off who you are, what you're about, and what you've accomplished. We will focus on four main areas: The Home page, Bio page, Experience page, and Portfolio page. These initial four pages will make a strong presence for you on the web.

Our goal here is to practice writing semantic HTML, basic CSS, and to learn a bit about hosting our content on the web.
