  <h3>ServiceNow Visualization</h3>

  <h4>Technologies used: </h4><p>Python (Flask, Requests, Pandas), HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
  <h4>Challenges: </h4><p>The main challenge was how to turn the data obtained from the RESTful API into a graph. 
    My solution was creating python lists which I loop through and counted each low severity incident and high severity incident. This way it was easier to graph in numbers. 
  </p>
  <p>One takeaway from this project was using <b>os environ </b>library to save my credentials to the system rather than on my code.</p>

  <h3>Inventory App</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/Genius-Guavas/inventory-app" class="portfolio-item" target="_blank">
    <img src="./images/inventory.png" alt="Inventory App Collaboration Project" class="portfolio-img">
  </a> 
  <p><h4>Technologies used:</h4> JavaScript, Express.js, React-DOM</p>
  <p>As a team, our MVP was to create an app which can keep track of inventory, user can add and remove inventory, view items individually and all at once.  </p>
  <p>I wanted to take it one step further an added an "ADD TO CART" feature into the app. We also added some mobile features as a team.</p>
  <p><h4>Challenges:</h4> Since I created the add to cart feature after the app was finished, I needed to find a way to now add this feature without breaking the code. I used useState to set the cart after adding a product through an async function. </p>

  <h3>Oaks Pokedex</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/NACK-Pokedex/Oaks-Pokedex" class="portfolio-item" target="_blank">
    <img src="./images/api.png" alt="Pokedex Collaboration Project" class="portfolio-img">
  </a>
  <p><h4>Technologies used:</h4> JavaScript, Express.js, AUTH0, </p>
  <p>MVP was to create a RESTful API for Oak to update his pokedex, and allow other authorized scientists to do the same. The Pokedex must be kept safe from Team Rocket and other unauthorized users </p>
  <p><h4>Challenges:</h4> My biggest challenge was getting the databse for users to load, and I fixed this by revising my seedFn.js file, as it did not contain all paths to the database.</p>

  <h3>Movie Flixter</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/LeagueOfPythoners/MovieFlixter" class="portfolio-item" target="_blank">
    <img src="./images/movie.png" alt="Movie Flixter Project Icon" class="portfolio-img">
  </a>
  <p><h4>Technologies used:</h4> Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS </p>
  <p>MVP was to create a fully functional Web application with Client-side Single-Page Application. Our application should include multiple routes, global state management, be accessible, and contain a style component library.</p>
  <p><h4>Challenges:</h4> We completed our project using RapidAPI.com, which did not contain a endpoint to render all movies. To work arround this we created a Recently viewed section. Whenever the user clicks on a specific movie, we created a new movie from the movie model. Then we render all movies created when going to the Recently viewed section.</p>
