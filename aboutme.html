<article class="about-me" id="about-me">
<h2 class="title-about">Who I Am</h2>
<p class="about-body">My passion for technology began at the age of 10; being young, with English knowledge in a hispanic household meant I had to assist my parents with any tasks they could not understand due to the language barrier. </p>
<p class="about-body">Eventually this meant fixing router, and computer issues. With the help of Youtube and Google I was always able to find a solution. Thus becoming the "mega brain", as they called me, in my home.</p>
<p class = "about-body">As an adult now, I have become to love the feeling of finding a solution to a technical problem.
  The joy I feel after spending hours on a specific problem and finally finding a solution, it is unreal. As I worked through courses on my own time, during college, and through bootcamp with Multiverse, I knew this is what I wanted to do as a career. As a software engineer I know I will always be learning, improving my work, and, more importantly, happy especially when solving a problems for my team.
